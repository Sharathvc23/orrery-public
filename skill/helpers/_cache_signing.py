"""HMAC-signed org cache.

The org cache produced by ``discover_org.py`` is the
allowlist ``sign_request.py`` consults before signing a request
(see SECURITY.md). If the cache file can be written by anyone with
filesystem access to ``$OPENCLAW_HOME``, an attacker can poison it
to add a hostile org URL and trick the signing helper into
producing a signature for that host.

To prevent this, the cache is HMAC-SHA256-signed with a key derived
from the agent's identity private key seed. An attacker who cannot
read ``identity.json`` (mode 0o600) cannot forge a valid MAC.
A cache without a valid MAC is treated as empty — fail-closed.

This module is purely a helper; both ``discover_org.py``
(writer) and ``sign_request.py`` (reader) import it. It is NEVER
called by the LLM directly.
